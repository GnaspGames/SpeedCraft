## CREATING ##
# CheckPoints are invisible Armor Stands. We will build structures around them, so no need to see them.
# To create a CheckPoint, place an Armor Stand in the middle of the track (no more than 7 blocks wide), stand near it, and run the following command
# Substitute the name (CheckPoint_1) with the correct number
/entitydata @e[type=ArmorStand,r=3] {CustomName:"CheckPoint_1",NoGravity:true,Invisible:true,Invulnerable:true,DisabledSlots:2039583}
